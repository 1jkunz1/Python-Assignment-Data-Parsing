Simple Python Program


Background: A research group has created an on-line training program that consists of 6 chapters. For 
each chapter, the user is required to read a .pdf file (OverView), watch a training video (Movie), read 
some articles (Articles), look at some clinical tools (Clinical), go through a FAQ document (FAQ), read 
some case studies (Case) and take a quiz (Quiz). If they have completed any of these components, a 
date is recorded. Quiz scores have been recorded, and quiz answers have also been stored. If they have 
completed all of the components for a chapter, the value for the variable “Complete” will be “YES”, and 
if any component is missing, the value for the variable “Complete” will be “NO”. 
If a user has completed all 6 modules, they are eligible to receive a certificate. If they are missing any 
one of the components of any one of the modules, they cannot receive credit. The data for each user is 
organized as follows:
